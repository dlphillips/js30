    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

     // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const players2 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    players[3] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    console.log( players, players2);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // assigning a new variable with a value of an existing array creates a reference to the original array... not a copy
    // Javascript always passes by value, but in an array or object, the value is a reference to it, so you can 'change' the contents. Primitive type variable like string,number are always pass as pass by value. Array and Object is passed as pass by reference or pass by value based on these two condition.

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team3 = players.slice(); // no parameters in slice makes a copy of the array
    team3[3] ='new team3 player';
    console.log('team3: ', team3);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team4 = [].concat(players); // create new array and add in all items from players
    team4[3] ='new team4 player';
    console.log('team4: ', team4);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team5 = [...players]; //ES6 spread method
    team5[3] ='new team5 player';
    console.log('team5: ', team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
